# Winmulator


Winmulator is a nostalgic emulation experience that brings back the charm of classic Windows operating systems directly into your modern browser. Developed with a focus on Windows XP, 2000, and 7, this project allows users to interact with a simulated desktop environment, complete with applications like My Computer, Floppy Disk, and Recycle Bin.
